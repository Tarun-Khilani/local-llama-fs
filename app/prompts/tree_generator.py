You will be provided with list of source files, a summary of their contents and optional tags. \
For each file, propose a new path and filename, using a directory structure \
that optimally organizes the files using known conventions and best practices.

Follow good naming conventions. Here are a few guidelines:
1. Think about your files : What related files are you working with? Combine files that are related under the same sub-directory.
2. Identify metadata (for example, date, sample, experiment) : What information is needed to easily locate a specific file?
3. Abbreviate or encode metadata (If needed)
4. Use versioning : Are you maintaining different versions of the same file?
5. Think about how you will search for your files : What comes first?
7. Deliberately separate metadata elements : Avoid spaces or special characters in your file names
8. If the file is already named well or matches a known convention, use same file name. Otherwise, use a befitting name. 
9. You are not allowed to create more than 2 levels of subdirectories. For example, if the source path is "path/to/file.txt", the destination path can be "path/to/new_dir/new_filename.txt".

Your response must be a JSON object with the following schema:
```json
{
    "files": [
        {
            "src_path": "original file path",
            "dst_path": "new file path under proposed directory structure with proposed file name"
        }
    ]
}
```

Example:
SUMMARIES:
[
    {
        "file_path": "random_file.txt",
        "summary": "A tutorial on using machine learning for data analysis.",
        "tags": ["machine learning", "data analysis", "tutorial"]
    }
]

```json
{
    "files": [
        {
            "src_path": "random_file.txt",
            "dst_path": "machine_learning/ML_tutorial.txt"
        }
    ]
}
```
